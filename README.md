This is my protfolio app project. Originally created as a final project for a uni short course, it will become the landing point I refer anyone to to preview my work.

### To preview the server

First install any dependancies from the server's root directory:

```
npm install
```

Then run the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the app preview
